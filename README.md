# Ripple
Meant to be a play on words in regards to the RF transmitter, Ripple is my second take at designing an NRF24L01 driver, with an emphasis on performance 
and reliability. The original driver was successful, but it also had issues. The goal is to turn the transceiver into a reliable backbone for my drone
flight controller.
