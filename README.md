# Ripple
Meant to be a play on words in regards to the RF transmitter, Ripple is my second take at designing an NRF24L01 driver, with an emphasis on performance and  
reliability. The original driver was successful for my first ever attempt at networking, but it also had some issues. I want to take what I learned there 
and try to create something better.  

The original driver can be found here: https://github.com/brandonbraun653/RF24Node
